    <h2>History of Pizza</h2>
    <p>The history of pizza begins in antiquity, when various ancient cultures produced basic flatbreads with several toppings.<br>
      A precursor of pizza was probably the focaccia, a flat bread known to the Romans as panis focacius, to which toppings were then added.<br> 
      Modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early 19th century.<br><br>
      
      The word pizza was first documented in A.D. 997 in Gaeta and successively in different parts of Central and Southern Italy.<br>
      Pizza was mainly eaten in Italy and by emigrants from there.<br>
      This changed after World War II when Allied troops stationed in Italy came to enjoy pizza along with other Italian foods.</p>
