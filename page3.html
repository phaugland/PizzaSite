      <h2>Calzone</h2>
      <p>A calzone (UK: /kælˈtsoʊni, -neɪ/, US: /kælˈzoʊn, -zoʊneɪ, -ni/, Italian: [kalˈtsoːne]; "stocking" or "trouser") is an Italian oven-baked folded pizza that originated in Naples in the 18th century.<br> 
        A typical calzone is made from salted bread dough, baked in an oven and is stuffed with salami, ham or vegetables, mozzarella, ricotta and Parmesan or pecorino cheese, as well as an egg.<br>
        Different regional variations in or on a calzone can often include other ingredients that are normally associated with pizza toppings.<br>
        The term usually applies to an oven-baked turnover rather than a fried pastry (i.e. panzerotti), though calzoni and panzerotti are often mistaken for each other.<br><br>

        A calzone is somewhat similar to a stromboli. A calzone is a baked turnover stuffed with pizza ingredients.<br>
        A stromboli is usually made by rolling up dough with cheese and meat ingredients and is then baked, but it does not generally contain pizza ingredients aside from cheese and Italian meats. Generally, strombolis do not usually contain tomato sauce, unlike calzones.<br>
        A calzone is crescent-shaped, and a stromboli is usually shaped like a long cylinder.<br>
        The distinction between the two is complicated because there is some variation in what constitutes a stromboli.</p>

      <h2>Detroit-style</h2>
      <p>Detroit-style pizza is a style of pizza developed in Detroit, Michigan. It is a rectangular pizza that has a thick crisp crust and toppings such as pepperoni and mushrooms.<br><br>

        The rectangular-shaped pizza is the result of being baked in a square pan, which is often not a pizza pan; industrial parts trays are often used, which were originally made to hold small parts in factories.<br><br>
        
        The difference between Detroit-style pizza, Chicago and New York styles is the crust, which is extra thick and very crispy on the bottom. Some parlors will apply melted butter with a soft brush prior to baking. The resulting pizza has a chewy texture.</p>

      <h2> New York-style</h2>
      <p>
        New York-style pizza is pizza made with a characteristically large hand-tossed thin crust, often sold in wide slices to go. The crust is thick and crisp only along its edge, yet soft, thin, and pliable enough beneath its toppings to be folded in half to eat. Traditional toppings are simply tomato sauce and shredded mozzarella cheese.<br><br>

        This style evolved in the U.S. from the pizza that originated in New York City in the early 1900s, itself derived from the Neapolitan style pizza made in Italy. Today it is the dominant style eaten in the New York Metropolitan Area states of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, and variously popular throughout the United States. Regional variations exist throughout the Northeast and elsewhere in the U.S.

      <h2>Chicago-style</h2>
      <p>
        Chicago-style pizza is pizza prepared according to several different styles developed in Chicago. The most famous is deep-dish pizza. The pan in which it is baked gives the pizza its characteristically high edge which provides ample space for large amounts of cheese and a chunky tomato sauce. Chicago-style pizza may be prepared in deep-dish style and as a stuffed pizza.
